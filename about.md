## hi

You have found the website of Tobias Kloht, a software developer in Berlin.

At the moment I am mostly developing frontend javascript with React, and am very happy with that. Other areas of interest include workflow automation, everything related to computer networks and developing for mobile devices.

When not staring at a screen I like to climb volcanoes in Indonesia with Jil and try to learn playing guitar.
